# SCCER Model Coupling
Code for the coupling of MATSim with various energy-related models

## Structure of the repository
For the moment, only a java part to post-process MATSim event, and a Python 3 part for analysis.
This will need to be restructured when more models are considered.

Ideally, a makefile-like setting should allow to run the whole process from A to Z for all possible scenarios.
Need to investigate if this can be done using gradle.
